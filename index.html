<h1></h1>

<p>A convolutional neural network is made up of many layers of neurons, or nodes, that hold a value. 
There are also many synapses connecting each neuron, like a link between the nodes. This model is based
off of how our brains work. In a neural network, a synapse is fired and then determines the value of the 
neuron it is connected to. Each synapse also has a weight and a bias that go into calculating the value of
the next neuron. This is similar to how our brains' synapses grow stronger with use, which is how we remember
events or information. </p>

<p>Each layer in a convolutional neural network is made up of feature maps, or many neurons that share similar synapses. 
In these feature maps, the output for each neuron is dependent on the neurons in the previous layer, and their weights.
This helps segment the data into so called feature points. Many feature maps make up a layer, which all make up networks.</p>

<p>When the network learns, or adjusts the weights based off of labeled data, it uses a process of both discriminating and generating data.
In each layer, the network first discriminates, then generates, then discriminates again, forming what is known as a Markov Chain. Then, alternating 
Gibbs sampling is used to then find the difference between the first discriminated layer and the layer that was discriminated after "reconstruction." 
These values are then multiplied by a small value, or the learning rate of the network. This is done for each layer going up through the network, creating
a recursion learning based off of the adjusted weights in the previous layer. This entire process is often called "pretraining" as it is less accurate than
traditional methods (such as backpropagation) but helps learn the correct neighborhood to then fine-tune the network in.</p>

<p>The next process in learning, backpropagation, is found using the error of the entire network. The derivative of this function is found with respect to the 
weights, so that each weight can find the role it had in the error of the network. These derivatives are then used to find the minimum of the error function. 
An issue with this algorithm is that the network can become stuck in a local minimum instead of finding the global minimum of the network.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>This API has a neural network premade, with code to discriminate, generate, and teach. Note that a new input must be set for each iteration of
discriminating, generating, or teaching. There is also a custom file format created especially for CNNs, consisting only of the data for each layer's 
weights.</p>
